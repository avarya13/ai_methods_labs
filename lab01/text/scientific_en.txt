The NPW matched filter is a linear observer model whose template is the difference between the expected signal and the expected background. 
Under the assumption that the noise is wide-sense stationary within a small ROI, and that the system behaves in a quasi-linear fashion, the detectability index for the NPW observer was calculated via FFT. 
The detectability index for the observer is calculated by use of the means and variances over an ensemble
